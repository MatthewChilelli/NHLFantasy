 C++ is known for its high performance and is often used in resource-intensive applications like game development and system programming.

When vectors are in your brainstorming phase vectors can be only declared in C++.
struct Player {
    std::string firstName;
    std::string lastName;
    int points;
};

// Function declarations
void printMenu();
void getUpdatedList(std::vector<Player>& playerList);
void showFantasyPoints(const std::vector<Player>& playerList);
void shootoutGame(std::vector<Player>& playerList);
void manuallyAdd(std::vector<Player>& playerList);
void manuallyDelete(std::vector<Player>& playerList);

C++ was created by Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, in the early 1980s at Bell Labs.
Stroustrup started working on C++ in 1979, aiming to add object-oriented programming features to the C language.
The first standardized version of C++, known as C++98, was published in 1998. 
This standardization helped ensure the consistency and portability of the language across different platforms.
C++ has remained a widely used programming language, particularly in systems programming, game development, and performance-critical applications.

C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language.
C++ inherits its procedural programming capabilities from the C language.
C++ is known for its strong support for object-oriented programming.
It allows developers to define classes and objects, encapsulate data and behavior within those classes.
C++ supports generic programming through templates.
While C++ is not a pure functional programming language, it does incorporate some functional programming features.
C++ provides low-level programming capabilities similar to those of C.
This flexibility has contributed to C++'s widespread use in a variety of application domains, including system programming, game development, embedded systems, and more.

The basic syntax of C++ is similar to that of the C programming language, as C++ was initially developed as an extension of C.
// This is a single-line comment
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    // Code goes here
    return 0;
}
int float double char and bool are the data types
has the normal operators

C++ is Static Typing and Strong Typing
User-Defined Types: C++ allows developers to create their own user-defined types using structures and classes.

By default, vectors in C++ are mutable.

Classes/Objects - Does your language have OOP capabilities?
